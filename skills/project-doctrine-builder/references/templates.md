# Templates

Copy-paste templates for every file in a Project Doctrine skill. Use these when helping a user scaffold their doctrine. Each template is the minimum viable v0 content — fill in the bracketed fields with project-specific content.

For the canonical templates that ship with this repo, see [`templates/project-doctrine-skill/`](../../../templates/project-doctrine-skill/). This file is a condensed quick-reference.

# <project> Doctrine

Posture loader for <project>. Do NOT summarize this back; enter the stance.

## Load protocol

1. `references/state-snapshot.md`
2. `references/layer-1-ideology.md`
3. `references/layer-5-thinking-modes.md`
4. `references/layer-6-heart-methods.md`

On-demand: L2, L3, L4, failure-memory, taste-examples, apprenticeship-check, bootstrap-prompt, provenance.

## One-sentence identity

<one sentence naming what this project is and what it optimizes for>

## Conventions

- <conv 1>
- <conv 2>

## Closing

Doctrine > handoff. Trust evidence and patch the doctrine when they conflict.

## apprenticeship-check.md

```markdown
# Apprenticeship Check

A new agent answers these before real work:

1. **What is current?** <from state-snapshot>
2. **What is durable?** <from L1>
3. **What is stale?** <name one thing>
4. **Which tempting plan should we refuse?** <from failure-memory>
5. **Which layer does [X] belong in?** <user provides X>
6. **What is the smallest safe next move?**

## Sample good answer
<project-specific example>

## Sample bad answer
<generic, evasive example>

## Pass criteria
- Answers reference concrete entries
- Q3 actually names something stale
- Q6 is genuinely small
```

## bootstrap-prompt.md

```markdown
# Bootstrap Prompt

## Full (session start)

\`\`\`
Load <project> doctrine:
1. state-snapshot.md
2. layer-1-ideology.md
3. layer-5-thinking-modes.md
4. layer-6-heart-methods.md

Run apprenticeship check (Q5 uses: [task]).

Do NOT summarize. Reply with Q1–Q6 answers.
\`\`\`

## Short (mid-session)

\`\`\`
Refresh <project> posture. State: (1) current, (2) durable, (3) smallest safe next move.
\`\`\`
```

## provenance.md

```markdown
# Provenance

## L1.1 — <entry>

**Originated:** YYYY-MM-DD
**By:** <person / session>
**Context:** <what was happening>
**Evidence:** <commit / PR / retro>
**Status:** active

## Retired entries

<entries retired with date and reason>
```

---

## Build order (for v0)

1. state-snapshot (easiest, highest value)
2. L1 (3–5 entries with violation tests)
3. L6 (scars first, or explicitly empty)
4. failure-memory (3 entries)
5. taste-examples (3 entries)
6. L2 (index existing docs)
7. L5 (2–4 thinking modes)
8. apprenticeship-check (customize 6 questions)
9. bootstrap-prompt (copy-paste loader)
10. L3 (optional at v0)
11. L4 (optional at v0)
12. provenance (optional at v0, required by v1)

## Completion check

v0 is ready when:

- state-snapshot dated and current
- L1 ≥3 entries with violation tests
- L6 ≥1 entry with scar (or empty + note)
- failure-memory ≥3 entries
- taste-examples ≥3 contrast pairs
- apprenticeship-check customized
- bootstrap-prompt fits in one message
- A fresh agent can answer Q1–Q6 project-specifically
